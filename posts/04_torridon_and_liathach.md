This time we fly. An early pick up to get us to Manchester airport and on the Logainair flight to Inverness.  No delays and takeoff into clear skies, England zips by beneath and we land in Inverness less than an hour later.  We wouldn't have even reached the Lake District yet had we driven.

Pick up the car and drive to Torridon. Small village at the foot of Liathach (The Big Grey One).

Food supplies and arrive in torridon

Where do we set camp.  Camp site closed, look for suitable wild camp spot and the  drive out to waterfalls, nothing there, nothing anywhere...until back into torridon and just at the end of our route ext we find the perfect spot.

Liathach route in by the carpark.  Aggressive 1-2 hours incline to 900meteres turn right first summit, come back towards liathach, traverse the ridge and then descend back to camp.  Food in bags by the river  never tasted so good.  Back home and can't wait for 2022.  We will never drive again.
