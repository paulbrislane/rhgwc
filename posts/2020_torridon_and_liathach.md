## The Grey One

The name Liathach means 'The grey one'. When seen from the roadside below, its slopes appear to rise up in a series of near vertical rocky terraces.

### Day 1

This is the first time the walking club has flown to Scotland and have will never drive to Scotland again...probably. Manchester to Inverness in an hour. Pick up the hire car and drive an hour to Torridon...too easy.

Finding a wild camping spot proved difficult in the village of Torridon and a few hours spent hunting for a suitable place to camp was spent. A suitable spot was eventually found a half mile out from the village in a small wood at the foot of the mountain, it proved to be perfect.

### Day 2

An early start and straight on to the mountain from the roadside car park. Up on the summit ridge after a 2 hour ascent.
